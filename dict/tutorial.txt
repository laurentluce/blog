This post describes how dictionaries are implemented in the Python language.

Dictionaries are indexed by keys and they can be seen as associative arrays. Let's add 3 key/value pairs to a dictionary:

[code lang="bash"]
>>> d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
>>> d['c'] = 3
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}
[/code]

The values can be accessed this way:

[code lang="bash"]
>>> d['a']
1
>>> d['b']
2
>>> d['c']
3
>>> d['d']
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
KeyError: 'd'
[/code]

The key 'd' does not exist so a KeyError exception is raised.

<h2>Hash tables</h2>

Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. It is an array whose indexes are obtained using a hash function on the keys. The goal of a hash function is to distribute the keys evenly in the array. A good hash function minimizes the number of collisions e.g. different keys having the same hash.

We are going to assume that we are using strings as keys for the rest of this post. The hash function for strings in Python is defined as:

[code lang="text"]
arguments: string object
returns: hash
function string_hash:
    if hash cached:
        return it
    set len to string's length
    initialize var p pointing to 1st char of string object
    set x to value pointed by p left shifted by 7 bits
    while len >= 0:
        set var x to (1000003 * x) xor value pointed by p
        increment pointer p
    set x to x xor length of string object
    cache x as the hash so we don't need to calculate it again
    return x as the hash
[/code]

If you run hash('a') in Python, it will execute string_hash() and return 12416037344. Here we assume we are using a 64-bit machine.

If an array of size x is used to store the key/value pairs then we use a mask equal to x-1 to calculate the slot index of the pair in the array. For example, if the size of the array is 8, the index for 'a' will be: hash('a') & 7 = 0. The index for 'b' is 3, the index for 'c' is 2, the index for 'z' is 3 which is the same as 'b', here we have a collision.

<img src="/images/blog/dict/hash.png" alt="hash table">

We can see that the Python hash function does a good job when the keys are consecutive which is good because it is quite common to have this type of data to work with. However, once we add the key 'z', there is a collision because it is not consecutive enough.
  
We could use a linked list to store the pairs having the same hash but it would increase the lookup time e.g. not O(1) anymore. The next section describes the collision resolution method used in the case of Python dictionaries.

<h2>Open addressing</h2>

Open addressing is a method of collision resolution where probing is used. In case of 'z', the slot index 3 is already used in the array so we need to probe for a different index to find one which is not already used. Adding a key/value pair might take more time because of the probing but the lookup will be O(1) and this is the desired behavior.

A quadratic probing sequence is used to find a free slot. The code is the following:

[code lang="text"]
i is the current slot index
set perturb to hash
forever loop:
  set i to i << 2 + i + perturb + 1
  set slot index to i & mask
  if slot is free:
      return it
  right shift perturb by 5 bits
[/code]

Let's see how this probing works when we start with i = 3:
3 -> 3 -> 5 -> 5 -> 6 -> 0...
This is not a really good example because we are using a small table of size 8 and this probing starts showing its advantages on larger tables. In our case, index 5 is free so it will be picked for key 'z'.

Just out of curiosity, let's look at the probing sequence when the table size is 32 e.g. mask = 31
3 -> 11 -> 19 -> 29 -> 5 -> 6 -> 16 -> 31 -> 28 -> 13 -> 2...

You can read more about this probing sequence by looking at the source code of <a href="http://svn.python.org/projects/python/trunk/Objects/dictobject.c">dictobject.c</a>. A detailed explanation of the probing mechanism can be found at the top of the file.

Now, let's look at the Python internal code along with an example.

<h2>Dictionary C structures</h2>

The following C structure is used to store a dictionary entry: key/value pair. The hash, key and value are stored. PyObject is the base class of the Python objects.

[code lang="c"]
typedef struct {
    Py_ssize_t me_hash;
    PyObject *me_key;
    PyObject *me_value;
} PyDictEntry;
[/code]

The following structure represents a dictionary. ma_fill is the number of used slots + dummy slots. A slot is marked dummy when a key pair is removed. ma_used is the number of used slots (active). ma_mask is equal to the array's size minus 1 and is used to calculate the slot index. ma_table is the array and ma_smalltable is the initial array of size 8.

[code lang="c"]
typedef struct _dictobject PyDictObject;
struct _dictobject {
    PyObject_HEAD
    Py_ssize_t ma_fill;
    Py_ssize_t ma_used;
    Py_ssize_t ma_mask;
    PyDictEntry *ma_table;
    PyDictEntry *(*ma_lookup)(PyDictObject *mp, PyObject *key, long hash);
    PyDictEntry ma_smalltable[PyDict_MINSIZE];
};
[/code]

<h2>Dictionary initialization</h2>

When you first create a dictionary, the function PyDict_New() is called. I removed some of the lines and converted the C code to pseudocode to concentrate on the key concepts.

[code lang="text"]
returns new dictionary object
function PyDict_New:
    allocate new dictionary object
    clear dictionary's table
    set dictionary's number of used slots + dummy slots (ma_fill) to 0
    set dictionary's number of active slots (ma_used) to 0
    set dictionary's mask (ma_value) to dictionary size - 1 = 7
    set dictionary's lookup function to lookdict_string
    return allocated dictionary object
[/code]

<h2>Adding items</h2>

When a new key/value pair is added, PyDict_SetItem() is called. This function takes a pointer to the dictionary object and the key/value pair. It checks if the key is a string and calculates the hash or reuses the one cached if it exists. insertdict() is called to add the new key/value pair and the dictionary is resized if the number of used slots is greater than 2/3 of the array's size.
Why 2/3? It is to make sure the probing sequence can find a free slot fast enough. We will look at the resizing function later.

[code lang="text"]
arguments: dictionary, key, value
returns: 0 if OK or -1
function PyDict_SetItem:
    set mp to point to dictionary object
    if key's hash cached:
        use hash
    else:
        calculate hash
    set n_used to dictionary's number of active slots (ma_used)
    call insertdict with dictionary object, key, hash and value
    if key/value pair added successfully and capacity over 2/3:
        call dictresize to resize dictionary's table
[/code]

inserdict() uses the lookup function to find a free slot. This is the next function we are going to examine. lookdict_string() calculates the slot index using the hash and the mask values. If it cannot find the key in the slot index = hash & mask, it probes using the perturb loop we saw above.

[code lang="text"]
arguments: dictionary object, key, hash
returns: dictionary entry
function lookdict_string:
    calculate slot index based on hash and mask
    if slot's key matches or slot's key is not set:
        returns slot's entry
    if slot's key marked as dummy (was active):
        set freeslot to this slot's entry
    else:
        if slot's hash equals to hash and slot's key equals to key:
            return slot's entry
        set var freeslot to null
    we are here because we couldn't find the key so we start probing
    set perturb to hash
    forever loop:
        set i to i << 2 + i + perturb + 1
        calculate slot index based on i and mask
        if slot's key is null:
            if freeslot is null:
                return slot's entry
            else:
                return freeslot
        if slot's key equals to key or slot's hash equals to hash
            and slot is not marked as dummy:
            return slot's entry
        if slot marked as dummy and freeslot is null:
            set freeslot to slot's entry
        right shift perturb by 5 bits
[/code]

We want to add the following key/value pairs: {'a': 1, 'b': 2', 'z': 26, 'y': 25, 'c': 5, 'x': 24}. This is what happens:

A dictionary structure is allocated with internal table size of 8.

      <li>ma_used = 6, ma_fill = 6</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</ul>

This is what we have so far:

<img src="/images/blog/dict/insert.png" alt="python dictionary insert">

6 slots on 8 are used now so we are over 2/3 of the array's capacity. dictresize() is called to allocate a larger array. This function also takes care of copying the old table entries to the new table.

dictresize() is called with minused = 24 in our case which is 4 * ma_used. 2 * ma_used is used when the number of used slots is very large (greater than 50000). Why 4 times the number of used slots? It reduces the number of resize steps and it increases sparseness.

The new table size needs to be greater than 24 and it is calculated by shifting the current size 1 bit left until it is greater than 24. It ends up being 32 e.g. 8 -> 16 -> 32.

[code lang="text"]
arguments: dictionary object, (2 or 4) * active slots
returns: 0 if OK, -1 otherwise
function dictresize:
    calculate new dictionary size:
        set var newsize to dictionary size
        while newsize less or equal than (2 or 4) * active slots:
            set newsize to newsize left shifted by 1 bit
    set oldtable to dictionary's table
    allocate new dictionary table
    set dictionary's mask to newsize - 1
    clear dictionary's table
    set dictionary's active slots (ma_used) to 0
    set var i to dictionary's active + dummy slots (ma_fill)
    set dictionary's active + dummy slots (ma_fill) to 0
    copy oldtable entries to dictionary's table using new mask
    return 0
}
[/code]

This is what happens with our table during resizing: a new table of size 32 is allocated. Old table entries are inserted into the new table using the new mask value which is 31. We end up with the following:

<img src="/images/blog/dict/resizing.png" alt="python dictionary table resizing">

<h2>Removing items</h2>

PyDict_DelItem() is called to remove an entry. The hash for this key is calculated and the lookup function is called to return the entry. The key for this entry is set to the dummy key. Dummy entries are entries which contained a key in the past but have not been reused yet. The probe sequence use the dummy information in case of collision to know that those entries held an active pair in the past.

[code lang="text"]
arguments: dictionary object, key
returns 0 if OK, -1 otherwise
function PyDict_DelItem:
    if key's hash cached:
        use hash
    else:
        calculate hash
    look for key in dictionary using hash
    if slot not found:
        return -1
    set slot's key to dummy
    set slot's value to null
    decrement dictionary active slots 
    return 0
[/code]

We want to remove the key 'c' from our dictionary. We end up with the following array:

<img src="/images/blog/dict/delete.png" alt="Python dictionary delete key">

Note that the delete item operation doesn't trigger an array resize if the number of used slots is much less that the total number of slots. However, when a key/value pair is added, the need for resize is based on the number of used slots so it can shrink the array too if the new size is the original size of the array: 8 by default.

That's it for now. I hope you enjoyed the article. Please write a comment if you have any feedback.
